# Agent

## The Simple Analogy

If a standard LLM is like a **knowledgeable consultant** who gives great advice, an Agent is like a **capable intern** who can actually go out and do tasks for you.

Think of the difference between:
- **Consultant**: "You should research your competitors and create a summary"
- **Intern**: *Actually goes and researches competitors, then creates the summary*

## How Agents Work: The ReAct Process

Agents use a **Reason + Act** cycle:

### Step 1: REASON ü§î
Agent thinks: *"To complete this task, I need to first search for information about our competitors."*

### Step 2: ACT üîß
Agent uses a tool: *Performs web search for "company competitors analysis"*

### Step 3: REASON ü§î
Agent thinks: *"Now I have the search results. I need to read the top 3 articles."*

### Step 4: ACT üîß
Agent uses tool: *Clicks and reads the articles*

### Step 5: REASON ü§î
Agent thinks: *"I have enough information. Now I'll create a summary."*

### Step 6: ACT üìù
Agent delivers: *Creates and presents the competitive analysis summary*

## Real Office Example: Market Research Agent

**Your Request**: "Create a summary of our top 3 competitors' recent product launches"

**Agent's Process**:
1. **Reason**: "I need to identify the company's competitors first"
2. **Act**: Searches for "[Your Company] competitors"
3. **Reason**: "Found 5 competitors, I'll focus on the top 3"
4. **Act**: Searches for recent product launches for each competitor
5. **Reason**: "I have launch information, now I'll organize it"
6. **Act**: Creates structured summary with key details
7. **Deliver**: Presents final competitive analysis report

**Time Saved**: What would take you 2-3 hours takes the agent 10-15 minutes

```

### 2. Set Boundaries and Rules
```
- Never commit to dates without checking my calendar

- Include disclaimer in all automated responses
- Require approval for emails to C-level executives
```

### 3. Provide Access and Permissions
